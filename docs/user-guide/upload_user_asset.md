DataEx users can upload their own shape files and use the forecast analysis engine to perform analysis using the shapefile. Below, we explain how you can upload your shapefile. 

### User assets
Go to <a href="{{interwiki.home}}">DataEx home page</a> then click on user profile tab to get a drop down menu and select profile view. This will take you to your user profile page where you can see your user details, permissions, account settings and also assets.
