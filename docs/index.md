* [x] `dataex_list_reducers.py` - Retrieve reducer names available for use in forecast analysis
* [x] `dataex_region_data_analysis.py` - Download ECMWF HRES/ENS/SEAS model forecast region data analysis 

### Example

Let's take a look at a quick example of one of the above commands. It's as easy as typing the command into your favourite terminal. Suppose we want to download a netCDF subset file from model `hres` for parameters `u10, swvl1, t2m`. We can use the following command, 

```
$ dataex_netcdf_subset.py --model_type hres --params u10,swvl1,t2m --latbounds 40.3 60.0 --lonbounds 90.0 120.0 --output /home/user/hres_subset.nc

``` 
Alternatively, you can use short forms of the option names used in the above command.
