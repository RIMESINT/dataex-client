- Download summary of observation data.
- Download raw netcdf data of ECMWF HRES/ENS/SEAS forecasts for specific region and parameter.
- List reducer names and user assets available for forecast data analysis.
- Download region specific forecast timeseries of ECMWF ENS/HRES/SEAS model forecasts.

### Installation

Dataex API client can be installed using the following command,
```
pip install https://github.com/nzahasan/dataex-client/zipball/master
```

### Commands

* [x] `dataex_init.py` - Create `.dataex_auth.json` file for dataex user authentication
* [x] `dataex_netcdf_subset.py` - Download raw netcdf subset of ECMWF HRES/ENS/SEAS model forecasts.
* [x] `dataex_list_country_info.py` - List information of countries
* [x] `dataex_obs_station_list.py` - List station(s) information of a specific country
* [x] `dataex_get_obs_data.py` - Download observation data.
* [x] `dataex_insert_obs_data.py` - Upload observation data.
* [x] `dataex_obs_data_summary.py` - Download summary of observation data.
* [x] `dataex_obs_parameter_list.py` - Retrieve a list of parameter information of a specific station
* [x] `dataex_list_user_assets.py` - List user assets available to use in forecast analysis
* [x] `dataex_list_reducers.py` - List reducer names available for use in forecast analysis
* [x] `dataex_region_data_analysis.py` - Download region specific forecast time series of ECMWF HRES/ENS/SEAS model forecasts.

### Example

Let's take a look at a quick example of one of the above commands. It's as easy as typing the command into your favourite terminal. Suppose we want to download a netCDF subset file from model `hres` for parameters `u10, swvl1, t2m`. We can use the following command, 

```
$ dataex_netcdf_subset.py --model_type hres --params u10,swvl1,t2m --latbounds 40.3 60.0 --lonbounds 90.0 120.0 --output /home/user/hres_subset.nc

``` 
Alternatively, you can use short forms of the option names used in the above command.
